# Firewatch

A NIST 800-30 aligned cybersecurity risk register. Track risks, score them by likelihood and impact, assign treatments, and monitor your risk posture over time.

## Features

- **Risk register** — create and manage risks with full NIST 800-30 fields (threat source, threat event, vulnerability, affected asset)
- **Scoring** — likelihood × impact matrix (1–5 scale) with score history tracking
- **Treatments** — attach mitigation plans with owners, deadlines, and status
- **Audit trail** — field-level change history on every risk
- **Dashboard** — summary cards, 5×5 risk matrix heatmap, and average score trend chart with date range filter
- **Review cadence** — set a reassessment frequency on each risk; the dashboard surfaces risks past their next review date, and re-scoring auto-schedules the next review
- **Role-based access** — admin, security analyst, risk owner, and executive viewer roles
- **Database flexibility** — SQLite out of the box, PostgreSQL for production

## How It Works

        end
    end

    Browser -->|"loads app"| Vite
    Vite -->|"serves React app"| React
    React -->|"API calls /api/*"| Vite
    Vite -->|"proxies to :8000"| FastAPI
    FastAPI -->|"validates JWT cookie"| Auth

```

**Request flow in plain English:**
1. You open the app — Vite serves the React frontend to your browser
2. React makes API calls to `/api/...` — Vite proxies those to the FastAPI backend
3. FastAPI checks your JWT cookie to verify who you are
4. The Risk Service applies business rules, SQLAlchemy talks to the database
5. Data flows back up the chain and renders in the browser

## Quick Start (Docker)

The only requirement is [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smoore0927/Firewatch.git
cd Firewatch
```

Copy the example config file:

```bash
# Mac / Linux / Windows (with make)
make setup

# Windows (without make)
copy firewatch-backend\.env.example firewatch-backend\.env
```

Open `firewatch-backend/.env` and set `SECRET_KEY` to a random value:

```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

Then start everything:

```bash
# Mac / Linux / Windows (with make)
make up

# Windows (without make)
docker compose up
```

Create the first admin account:

```bash
# Mac / Linux / Windows (with make)
make backend
python seed_admin.py

# Windows (without make)
docker compose exec backend bash
python seed_admin.py
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Configuration

All configuration lives in `firewatch-backend/.env`. The only required value is `SECRET_KEY`. Everything else has sensible defaults.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `SECRET_KEY` | *(required)* | Signs JWT tokens — generate with `secrets.token_hex(32)` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `sqlite:///./firewatch.db` | Use `postgresql://user:pass@host/db` for Postgres |
| `DEBUG` | `False` | Set `True` to enable `/docs` and `/redoc` |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost:3000` | Comma-separated list of allowed frontend origins |

## Manual Setup (without Docker)

**Backend**

```bash
cd firewatch-backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env            # then edit .env
alembic upgrade head            # skip for SQLite — tables are created automatically
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

**Frontend**

```bash
cd firewatch-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Commands

If you have `make` installed:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `make up` | Start all services |
| `make down` | Stop all services |
| `make build` | Rebuild Docker images |
| `make logs` | Follow logs from all services |
| `make backend` | Open a shell in the backend container |
| `make frontend` | Open a shell in the frontend container |

`make` is pre-installed on Mac and Linux. On Windows, install it with `winget install GnuWin32.Make` or use the Docker Compose commands directly:

| Equivalent | Docker Compose command |
|---|---|
| `make up` | `docker compose up` |
| `make down` | `docker compose down` |
| `make build` | `docker compose build` |
| `make logs` | `docker compose logs -f` |
| `make backend` | `docker compose exec backend bash` |
| `make frontend` | `docker compose exec frontend sh` |

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Recharts |
| Backend | FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2, Alembic, slowapi |
| Database | SQLite (default) / PostgreSQL |
| Auth | JWT via HTTP-only cookies |
| Container | Docker Compose |
